# 🧠 Mental Health Disorder Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to assist counselors and patients in identifying potential mental health disorders based on selected symptoms. The system uses a Machine Learning model trained in Python (Jupyter Notebook) to predict mental health conditions and provide recommendations. The web interface is built using JavaScript and CSS to deliver a seamless user experience.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using Python in Jupyter Notebook to predict mental disorders.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Developed using JavaScript and CSS for interactivity.
- **Counselor & Patient Guidance**: Provides advice and suggested actions based on predictions.
- **REST API Integration**: Uses Node.js and Postman for testing API requests.
- **Dynamic Predictions**: Users input symptoms, and the system predicts possible disorders with recommendations.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **User Inputs Symptoms**: The user selects symptoms from a predefined list.
2. **Model Predicts the Condition**: The trained ML model processes the input and predicts potential mental health disorders.
3. **Guidance & Recommendations**: The system suggests advice for both the counselor and the patient based on the prediction.
